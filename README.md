AIM:  
The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize geospatial data related to bus  
tracking, including speed analysis, route mapping, and identification of entry 
and exit points. By leveraging geospatial tools and techniques, the project aims 
to provide actionable insights for optimizing bus routes, improving fuel 
efficiency, and enhancing overall transportation efficiency and safety.  
OBJECTIVE:  
The primary objective of creating this project is to effectively monitor 
our vehicles' usage and ensure their proper care, especially when entrusted to drivers. Some drivers 
may not handle our vehicles responsibly, and in our absence, there's uncertainty about their treatment. 
In some cases, fuel theft may occur. To address these challenges, we developed the geospatial 
insights project. It enables us to analyze vehicle speed, generate map visualizations, and identify 
entry and exit points, ensuring better vehicle management and security.  
SOFTWARE TOOLS:  
• Python  
• Streamlit  
• Visual Studio Code  
METHODLOGY:  
The methodology for the "Geospatial Insights" 
project involves several key steps. It begins with data preparation, loading GPS 
data from a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, and cleaning the dataset by 
renaming columns, handling missing values, and removing duplicates. The 
project then moves to exploratory data analysis (EDA), displaying the dataset's 
shape and columns, providing options to handle missing values and duplicates 
interactively, calculating and displaying summary statistics, and showing the 
percentage distribution of unique values in fields. Next, the project conducts 
speed analysis, computing the average speed, minimum and maximum speeds, 
and identifying coordinates associated with overspeed instances. Map 
visualization is a significant component, using Folium to generate interactive 
maps for visualizing GPS data, offering various map options like overspeed 
maps, total coordinates maps, day-wise maps, compare maps, bus standby, and 
geo-fencing. The project also identifies entry and exit points based on GPS 
coordinates, categorizing them and distinguishing points during forenoon and 
afternoon periods for a detailed temporal understanding of vehicle movements. 
Throughout the process, users interact with the Streamlit interface, making 
selections, choosing dates, and observing visualizations, ensuring a dynamic 
and user-centric experience. Overall, the project aims to provide a 
comprehensive analysis of GPS data, uncovering patterns, anomalies, and 
significant locations through an engaging and interactive platform, showcasing 
the potential of combining Streamlit and Folium for creating insightful 
geospatial analytics applications.

Problems in existing system:  
                                                                          The current system faces several 
challenges due to a lack of effective monitoring and control over vehicle 
operations. This results in problems like unauthorized vehicle use, inefficient 
routing, and higher maintenance costs. Fuel theft is also a significant issue, as 
drivers may take advantage of unsupervised periods to steal fuel, leading to 
financial losses. Inadequate maintenance practices further worsen these 
problems, causing higher repair costs and shorter vehicle lifespans. The lack of 
detailed data collection and analysis makes it difficult to track important metrics 
such as vehicle speed, route adherence, and fuel usage. This limits the ability to 
make informed decisions about vehicle operations. Without proper monitoring, 
ensuring that drivers follow guidelines and drive responsibly is also 
challenging. These issues lead to operational inefficiencies, including 
suboptimal route planning and increased expenses. The Geospatial Insights 
project aims to address these challenges by improving vehicle oversight, 
reducing fuel theft, enhancing maintenance practices, and enabling better 
decision-making through advanced analysis and visualization tools.
